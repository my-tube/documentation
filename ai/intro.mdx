## 💔 Who is really in charge of your content?

You pour your heart into creating a video, upload it to the giants, and then… you lose control. They effectively **claim ownership of the content itself**, reserving the right to use it for their own purposes—whether that's training AI models or fueling their data-mining business. Every time you hit that upload button, you risk:

* Arbitrary decisions from bots or human moderators that lead to bans or video removal.
* Having your content rights quietly amended by platform policy changes.
* Losing access to your audience and content entirely if your account is suspended.

When you post on external platforms, you are a tenant. They are the landlords. And they can change the locks whenever they want.

**MyTube** changes the dynamic. You aren't the tenant anymore. **You are the owner.**

## ✅ Professional streaming. Zero monthly cost. 100% Yours.

MyTube isn't a "service" you sign up for—it's a self-hosted solution you deploy. It combines the world’s best infrastructure tools to give you a broadcasting station that rivals the big players.

* **Your Data Sovereignty:** Users, comments, and metadata live in your own Supabase database, safe from external intrusion.
* **Your High-Fidelity Delivery:** Videos are encoded and streamed via MUX (the same tech used by major broadcasters), guaranteeing quality without compromise.
* **Your Uncensored Rules:** You decide who watches. No shadow-banning. No "community guidelines" strikes.

## 💰 How is this free? (The Secret Sauce)

We’ve engineered MyTube to orchestrate the "Free Tiers" of the industry's most powerful tools. Because you are hosting your own instance, you get to utilize the generous individual limits of these providers:

* **MUX:** Professional encoding and streaming. **Cost: $0** (Covered by their $20/mo recurring credit).
* **Vercel:** Global CDN, fluid compute, and hosting the web app itself. **Cost: $0** (Hobby Tier).
* **Supabase:** Handles user auth, metadata, and database needs. **Cost: $0** (Free Tier).
* **Github:** Where your custom instance code lives and deploys from. **Cost: $0**.

*Note: You just need to register a domain name. That's the only thing you can't get for free!*

## 🔑 Share with the world, or just a chosen few.

MyTube gives you granular control over who sees what.

* ### 🌍 Public Access
    Broadcast to the world. Your homepage becomes a public gallery open to anyone to view without authentication.
* ### 🔗 Unlisted Link
    The "Speakeasy" mode. Videos are hidden from the homepage and only viewable by people with the direct link.
* ### 🔒 Private (Authenticated)
    Total lockdown. Videos are only visible to you and the specific authenticated users/groups you explicitly grant access to.

<section id="caveat">

## 🛠️ Some assembly required. (And that’s a good thing).

*(This section uses the anchor tag **#setup** for the CTAs to link to)*

Here is the catch: **MyTube** is not a one-click app store download. It is a powerful web application that you deploy yourself. To get set up, you will need to: fork our repo on Github, set up accounts, copy/paste environment variables, and run a simple SQL script.

> Is it technical? *Yes, a little.* Is it worth it? **Absolutely.**
> The setup process is the price of admission for total digital independence.
